# SoundSage Open Source License

This license agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between you ("Licensee") and Gabriel Lacroix, the owner ("Licensor") of the SoundSage project ("Software"). By using, modifying, or distributing the Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

## 1. Grant of License

Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, modify, and distribute the Software for educational or experimental purposes.

## 2. Restrictions

You may not use, modify, or distribute the Software for commercial purposes without the express written permission of the Licensor. You may not claim ownership or authorship of the Software. You may not grant a sublicense to the Software.

## Contributions

If you choose to contribute to this Software, your contributions will be governed by the following terms:

### Grant of License

By contributing to the Software, you hereby grant to the Licensor, and to recipients of the Software distributed by the Licensor, a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, and irrevocable license to use, reproduce, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and sublicense your contributions, and any derivative works thereof, in connection with the Software and the Licensor's (and its successors' and assigns') business, including, without limitation, for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Software (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. This license includes the right to use your contributions for the development and enhancement of the Software.

### Representation and Warranty

You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights, licenses, consents, and permissions to grant the licenses set forth in this section. You represent that your contributions are your original works of authorship, and to the extent your contributions incorporate works of authorship owned by third parties, you represent that you have obtained all necessary permissions from the applicable third-party owners to grant the licenses set forth in this section.

### Contributor

A "contributor" is any person or entity that submits, contributes, or otherwise provides direct or indirect material or work to the Software, including modifications or additions to existing work. A contributor version refers to any such contributions made by a contributor to the Software.

### Patent License

Each contributor also grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. This includes, but is not limited to, the right to implement any algorithms, processes, or methodologies included in the contributions.

### No Guarantee of Use

There is no guarantee that your contributions will be used in the final product. Decisions regarding the integration of contributions into the Software are entirely at the Licensor's discretion.

### No Immediate Compensation

You acknowledge that you will not receive any immediate compensation for your contributions. However, in the event of any kind of monetization on the Licensor's end, contributors whose contributions are used in the final product will be considered and paid upon the receipt of monetization. The specific terms and conditions relating to such compensation will be agreed upon in a separate agreement.

Please note, contributing to the Software means accepting and adhering to these terms. If you disagree with any part of these terms, then you may not contribute to the Software.

## 4. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the Software.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall Licensor be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this Software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.

## 6. Termination

This Agreement will continue in effect until terminated. If you violate any term of this Agreement, your rights under this Agreement will terminate automatically.

## 7. General

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensor resides. If any part of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

## 8. Source Code

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work. The source code for a work in source code form is that same work.

## 9. Propagation and Conveyance

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

## 10. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Software. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

## 11. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
