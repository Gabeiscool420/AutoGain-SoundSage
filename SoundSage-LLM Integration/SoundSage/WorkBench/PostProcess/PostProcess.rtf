PostProcess

This is where the AudioTool interaction script will move the processed files. 
once the list of specified files is finished the script will send a signal to either complete the loop and tell
the LLM to respond to the user or if there is further processing to be done than it will move the processed files back 
in to the PreProcess folder.
