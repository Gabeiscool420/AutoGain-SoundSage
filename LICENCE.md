<h1>SoundSage Open Source License</h1>

<p>This license agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between you ("Licensee") and Gabriel Lacroix, the owner ("Licensor") of the SoundSage project ("Software"). By using, modifying, or distributing the Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<h2>1. Grant of License</h2>

<p>Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, modify, and distribute the Software for educational or experimental purposes.</p>

<h2>2. Restrictions</h2>

<p>You may not use, modify, or distribute the Software for commercial purposes without the express written permission of the Licensor. You may not claim ownership or authorship of the Software. You may not grant a sublicense to the Software.</p>

<h2>3. Contributions</h2>

<p>If you contribute to the Software, you grant Licensor a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, modify, and distribute your contributions. You acknowledge that you will not receive any immediate compensation for your contributions. However, in the event of any kind of monetization on SoundSage's end, contributors whose contributions are used in the final product will be considered and paid upon the receipt of monetization. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to grant the licenses in this section.</p>

<h2>4. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>

<p>The Software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the Software.</p>

<h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>In no event shall Licensor be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this Software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.</p>

<h2>6. Termination</h2>

<p>This Agreement will continue in effect until terminated. If you violate any term of this Agreement, your rights under this Agreement will terminate automatically.</p>

<h2>7. General</h2>

<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensor resides. If any part of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<h2>8. Source Code</h2>

<p>The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work. The source code for a work in source code form is that same work.</p>

<h2>9. Propagation and Conveyance</h2>

<p>To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>

<p>To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>

<h2>10. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies</h2>

<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Software. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>

<h2>11. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients</h2>

<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>

<h2>12. Patents</h2>

<p>A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Software or a work on which the Software is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".</p>

<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
