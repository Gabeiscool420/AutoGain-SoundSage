8. **Openai_interaction.py**
    - [ ] Implement function for sending user's input to the OpenAI API.
    - [ ] Implement function for receiving and processing the response from the OpenAI API.

9. **Send_button_functionality.py**
    - [ ] Implement function that gets executed when the "Send" button is clicked.

10. **Template_code.py**
    - [ ] Implement function for modifying the template code based on user's input.

## AutoGain
AutoGain is the first of many audio tools that the SoundSage system uses to process audio based on a user's prompt. The AutoGain tool automates gain staging by analyzing the file and either boosting, turning down, or simply doing nothing to the specified file.
